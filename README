This is croma, a macro processor

How to compile croma:
	  Just type make in the croma source directory. This should build the croma executable.

Using croma:
      croma reads source code either from standard input or from a file passed as argument. It prints on
      stdout the processed document.
      
The croma language:
    Croma is quite different from languages like cpp or m4. Croma uses blocks to delimitate macros instead
    of considering that a macro definition ends at the end of a line.
    For the moment, croma recognizes only one syntactic form : foreach.
    foreach takes and infinite number of parameters separated by spaces (grouping will be implemented soon)
    and executes the block following it, successively binding to the variable $$ the value of the current
    word.
    
    example:
	foreach(bill marshall kirk)
	{{
		print "Hi, $$"
	}}

	This example will output :

	print "Hi, bill"
	print "Hi, marshall"
	print "Hi, kirk"
